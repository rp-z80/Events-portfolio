# Events-portfolio
My project for the Mobile Programming class, here as a part of my portfolio.

The project is an Android application and it's written entirely in the Kotlin programming language. It is a social network that allows to the usesers to create and partecipate
at every kind of social event. It uses the Google Maps APIs to find events next to the user and to locate an event at the moment of its creation. It uses Google Firebase 
as DB to register new users and to store their data. 

The main features are:
- Creation of users
- Login
- Events visualization
- Events search
- Profile viewer
- Profile customization
